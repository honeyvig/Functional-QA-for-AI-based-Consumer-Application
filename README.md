# Functional-QA-for-AI-based-Consumer-Application
We are building a consumer application - an AI chat bot. The product includes interactive chat component, login and payment workflows, and ~8 pages with ~25-30 variations. We are looking for an 5+ years experienced functional QA, with knowledge of API and databases to test the product. Experience with chat bot applications is preferred. Security testing experience will be preferred. There will be ~3 rounds of smoke testing and at least one round of full testing.

Responsibilities:

1. You will need to write a comprehensive list of test cases and get mutual agreement with product team.
    1. Test Plan: Outline the overall testing strategy, scope, objectives, and approach. It should include: Testing methodologies, Resource allocation, Timeline and schedules, Risk assessments, and Pass/fail criteria
    2. Test Cases: Detailed step-by-step instructions for testing. These should cover: Test scenario descriptions, Expected results, Actual results, Pass/fail status
2. You will need to do two rounds of testing: a) smoke testing while development is on-going, and, b) full suite of testing after development is complete. You will need to do 1) functional testing to test conversational flow and error handling, 2) User experience testing to test usability, and UI accuracy with design, 3) performance testing: load testing and integration testing.
3. You will need to provide extensive documentation of the test cases including,
    1. Test Logs: including, Date and time of test performance, Summary of executed test cases, Results achieved, Screenshots, Issues or observations noted during testing
    2. Bug Reports: Detailed documentation of any defects or issues found during testing including, bug description, repro steps, severity, and screenshots
    3. Regular Test Summary Reports: A high-level document summarizing the testing activities and results.=============
===================
To approach this project, we can break it down into several key steps for writing functional QA test cases, test plans, and documentation. The process will focus on testing the core functionalities of an AI chatbot, including login, payment workflows, and conversational interactions.

I’ll provide Python-based code for API testing, smoke testing, and some sample test cases. Additionally, I will also include structures for your Test Plan, Test Cases, and Test Summary Reports.
1. Test Plan

A Test Plan outlines your overall strategy for testing, the scope, methodologies, and the resources needed. Below is a sample template:

- Test is considered **Failed** if any critical defects are found during functional, performance, or security testing.

2. Test Cases (Python API Testing Example)

For API testing, you can use the requests library in Python. Below is an example of testing an API endpoint for the chatbot login, which could be part of your QA process.

First, install requests if you don't have it:

pip install requests

Example Python Code for API Testing:

import requests
import json

# Define the API endpoint and headers for login
API_URL = "https://yourchatbotapp.com/api/v1/login"
HEADERS = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

# Sample Test Case for Login API
def test_login_api():
    # Prepare test data
    payload = {
        "username": "testuser",
        "password": "testpassword123"
    }
    
    # Send POST request
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=HEADERS, json=payload)
    
    # Test Case 1: Check if the response status code is 200 (success)
    assert response.status_code == 200, f"Expected status code 200 but got {response.status_code}"
    
    # Test Case 2: Check if the response contains a token (for successful login)
    response_data = response.json()
    assert "token" in response_data, "Token not found in the response"
    
    # Print the results
    print("Login API Test Passed!")

# Run the test
test_login_api()

3. Smoke Testing

Smoke testing is performed to ensure that the major components of the application are working. For this, you would focus on testing critical functionalities like login, payments, and chatbot interaction.

Here’s a basic Python test for the smoke testing of the chatbot’s ability to respond to a simple message.

import requests

# Define the API URL for chatbot interaction
CHATBOT_API_URL = "https://yourchatbotapp.com/api/v1/chat"

def test_chatbot_smoke():
    user_input = {"message": "Hello, how can I get a quote?"}
    
    # Send POST request to the chatbot API
    response = requests.post(CHATBOT_API_URL, json=user_input)
    
    # Test Case 1: Ensure the status code is 200 (OK)
    assert response.status_code == 200, f"Expected status code 200, got {response.status_code}"
    
    # Test Case 2: Ensure the chatbot response is not empty
    response_data = response.json()
    assert "response" in response_data, "Chatbot response is missing"
    
    # Test Case 3: Validate if the response contains expected keywords (for basic validation)
    assert "quote" in response_data['response'].lower(), "Chatbot didn't respond with quote-related info"
    
    print("Chatbot Smoke Test Passed!")

# Run the test
test_chatbot_smoke()

4. Test Documentation

Once the tests are complete, it's essential to document the results:
Example Test Case Documentation:

# Test Case: Login API Validation
- **Test Scenario**: Test successful login with valid credentials.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Send a POST request to /api/v1/login with valid username and password.
  2. Verify that the response status code is 200.
  3. Verify that the response contains a valid JWT token.
- **Expected Result**: The API returns a status code of 200, and the response contains a JWT token.
- **Actual Result**: As expected, the status code was 200 and the response contained the token.
- **Pass/Fail**: Pass
- **Attachments**: [Screenshot of response]

Bug Report Example:

# Bug Report: Chatbot Error Handling
- **Bug ID**: #1234
- **Summary**: Chatbot does not recognize user input when the message contains special characters.
- **Severity**: High
- **Reproduction Steps**:
  1. Type a message with special characters (e.g., "!@#$%^&*").
  2. Observe the response.
- **Expected Result**: The chatbot should return a valid response.
- **Actual Result**: The chatbot crashes or returns an error.
- **Logs/Attachments**: [Error log or screenshot]

5. Test Summary Report Example:

# Test Summary Report

## Project: AI Chatbot Application
- **Test Lead**: [Name]
- **Testing Dates**: [Start Date] - [End Date]
- **Total Test Cases**: 50
- **Passed**: 45
- **Failed**: 5
- **Critical Bugs**: 1
- **Summary of Testing**:
  - Functional Testing: Passed 85% of cases, with 1 critical bug found in the login API.
  - Performance Testing: Load testing showed the system could handle up to 500 concurrent users.
  - Security Testing: No major security flaws were identified, though the login flow requires further hardening.
  - Usability Testing: Minor UI issues were identified in the chatbot UI, which will be fixed in the next sprint.

## Recommendations:
- Address the critical login bug (Bug #1234) before proceeding with the production release.
- Conduct more rigorous load testing with higher concurrency in the next round of testing.

Conclusion:

This process covers test case writing, testing strategies, and tools needed for functional, smoke, and performance testing. By following this approach, you'll be able to methodically test the AI chatbot application, identify bugs, and ensure that the application meets all requirements before release.
